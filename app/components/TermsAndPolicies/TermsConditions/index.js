              individuals to whom this Section applies: (1) an informal
              negotiation directly with AirGym’s customer service team, and (2)
              a binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration
              Association (“AAA”) using its specially designed Consumer
              Arbitration Rules (as modified by this Section). Specifically, the
              process provides:

              Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution and Notification. Prior to
              initiating an arbitration, you and AirGym each agree to notify the
              other party of the dispute and attempt to negotiate an informal
              resolution to it first. We will contact you at the email address
              you have provided to us; you can contact AirGym’s customer service
              team by <a href="mailto:customerservice@airgym.com">emailing</a>{" "}
              us. If after a good faith effort to negotiate one of us feels the
              dispute has not and cannot be resolved informally, the party
              intending to pursue arbitration agrees to notify the other party
              via email prior to initiating the arbitration. In order to
              initiate arbitration, a claim must be filed with the AAA and the
              written Demand for Arbitration (available at{" "}

              Agreement to Arbitrate. You and AirGym mutually agree that any

              Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement or interpretation
              thereof, or to the use of the AirGym Services, the Owner Services,
              or the Content Services (collectively, “Disputes”) will be settled
              by binding arbitration (the “Arbitration Agreement”). If there is
              a dispute about whether this Arbitration Agreement can be enforced
              or applies to our Dispute, you and AirGym agree that the
              arbitrator will decide that issue.

              Exceptions to Arbitration Agreement. You and AirGym each agree

              Agreement and will be brought in a judicial proceeding in a court
              of competent jurisdiction: (i) Any claim related to actual or
              threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a
              party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other
              intellectual property rights; (ii) Any claim seeking emergency
              injunctive relief based on exigent circumstances (e.g., imminent
              danger or commission of a crime, hacking, cyber-attack).

              Arbitration Rules and Governing Law. This Arbitration Agreement
              evidences a transaction in interstate commerce and thus the
              Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement
              of this provision. The arbitration will be administered by AAA in
              accordance with the Consumer Arbitration Rules (the “AAA Rules“)
              then in effect, except as modified here. The AAA Rules are
              available at {" "}

              Modification to AAA Rules - Arbitration Hearing/Location. In order
              to make the arbitration most convenient to you, AirGym agrees that
              any required arbitration hearing may be conducted, at your option,
              (a) in the county where you reside; (b) in San Francisco County;
              (c) in any other location to which you and AirGym both agree; (d)
              via phone or video conference; or (e) for any claim or
              counterclaim under $25,000, by solely the submission of documents
              to the arbitrator.
            </p>
            <p>
              Modification of AAA Rules - Attorney’s Fees and Costs. You may be
              entitled to seek an award of attorney fees and expenses if you
              prevail in arbitration, to the extent provided under applicable
              law and the AAA rules. Unless the arbitrator determines that your
              claim was frivolous or filed for the purpose of harassment, AirGym
              agrees it will not seek, and hereby waives all rights it may have
              under applicable law or the AAA rules, to recover attorneys’ fees
              and expenses if it prevails in arbitration.

              Arbitrator’s Decision. The arbitrator’s decision will include the
              essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based
              the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any
              court with proper jurisdiction. The arbitrator may award
              declaratory or injunctive relief only on an individual basis and
              only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the
              claimant’s individual claim.

              Jury Trial Waiver. You and AirGym acknowledge and agree that we
              are each waiving the right to a trial by jury as to all arbitrable
              Disputes.

              No Class Actions or Representative Proceedings. You and AirGym
              acknowledge and agree that we are each waiving the right to
              participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class
              action lawsuit, class-wide arbitration, private attorney-general
              action, or any other representative proceeding as to all Disputes.
              Further, unless you and AirGym both otherwise agree in writing,
              the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one party’s claims
              and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or
              representative proceeding. If this paragraph is held unenforceable
              with respect to any Dispute, then the entirety of the Arbitration
              Agreement will be deemed void with respect to such Dispute.

              that any portion of this Arbitration Agreement is deemed illegal
              or unenforceable, such provision shall be severed and the
              remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall be given full force

              Changes. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 3
              (“Modification of these Terms”), if AirGym changes this Section 19

              written notice (including by email) within thirty (30) days of the
              date such change became effective, as indicated in the “Last
