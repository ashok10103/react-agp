                &nbsp;9.1&nbsp; Each Member collecting payment for services
                provided via the AirGym Platform (such as Owner
                Services,Co-Owner Services)<strong> (“Providing Owner​”) </strong>hereby appoints
                AirGym as the Providing Owner’s payment collection agent solely
                for the limited purpose of accepting funds from Members
                purchasing such services <strong>(“Purchasing Members​”)</strong>.
              </p>
              <p>
                &nbsp;9.2&nbsp; Each Providing Owner agrees that payment made by
                a Purchasing Member through AirGym, shall be considered the same
                as a payment made directly to the Providing Owner, and the
                Providing Owner will provide the purchased services to the
                Purchasing Member in the agreed-upon manner as if the Providing
                Owner has received the payment directly from the Purchasing
                Member. Each Providing Owner agrees that AirGym may refund the
                Purchasing Member in accordance with the AirGym Terms. Each
                Providing Owner understands that AirGym’s obligation to pay the
                Providing Owner is subject to and conditional upon successful
                receipt of the associated payments from Purchasing Members.
                AirGym guarantees payments to Providing Owners only for such
                amounts that have been successfully received by AirGym Payments
                from Purchasing Members in accordance with these Payments Terms.
                In accepting appointment as the limited payment collection agent
                of the Providing Owner, AirGym assumes no liability for any acts
                or omissions of the Providing Owner.
              </p>
              <p>
                &nbsp;9.3 &nbsp;Each Purchasing Member acknowledges and agrees
                that, notwithstanding the fact that AirGym is not a party to the
                agreement between you and the Providing Owner, AirGym acts as
                the Providing Owner’s payment collection agent for the limited
                purpose of accepting payments from you on behalf of the
                Providing Owner. Upon your payment of the funds to AirGym, your
                payment obligation to the Providing Owner for the agreed upon
                amount is extinguished, and AirGym is responsible for remitting
                the funds to the Providing Owner in the manner described in
                these Payments Terms, which constitute AirGym’s agreement with
                the Purchasing Member. If AirGym does not remit any such
                amounts, the Providing Owner will have recourse only against
                AirGym and not the Purchasing Member directly.

                  even if a limited remedy set forth herein is found to have
                  failed of its essential purpose. Except for our obligations to
                  pay amounts to applicable Providing Owners pursuant to these
                  Payments Terms, in no event will AirGym’s aggregate liability

                  damages set forth above are fundamental elements of the basis
                  of the bargain between AirGym and you. Some jurisdictions do
                  not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for
                  consequential or incidental damages, so the above limitation
                  may not apply to you. If you reside outside of the U.S., this
                  does not affect AirGym Payments’ liability for death or
                  personal injury arising from its negligence, nor for

                notify the other party of the dispute and attempt to negotiate
                an informal resolution to it first. We will contact you at the
                email address you have provided to us; you can contact AirGym’s
                customer service team by emailing us. If after a good faith
                effort to negotiate one of us feels the dispute has not and
                cannot be resolved informally, the party intending to pursue
                arbitration agrees to notify the other party via email prior to
                initiating the arbitration. In order to initiate arbitration, a
                claim must be filed with the AAA and the written Demand for
                Arbitration (available at<a href="https://www.adr.org/">  www.adr.org</a>) provided to the other
                party, as specified in the AAA Rules.
